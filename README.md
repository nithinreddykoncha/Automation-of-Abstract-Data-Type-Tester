# Automation-of-Abstract-Data-Type-Tester
This project is automation of testing abstract data type header files. 
States are defined for the abstract data type. Each state gives definition for the ADT's such as size, element pushed or top element.
With the definition of each state we take a empty ADT use the logic written by the user, apply the actions as defined by the user and reach each state in order to check the correctness of the program.
